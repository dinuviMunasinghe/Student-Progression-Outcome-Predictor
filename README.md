# Student-Progression-Outcome-Predictor

The four programs are written in python.

Part one - The program should allow students to predict their progression outcome at the end of each
academic year.


Part two - The program allows a staff member to
predict progression outcomes for multiple students.


Part three - The program displays an additional histogram vertically so the stars in a category
should go downwards.
